      This option enables support for the Avago A320 optical motion sensor.
      The A320 detects movement along X and Y axes via optical sensing, 
      communicating over I2C with optional GPIO control for reset, motion 
      detection, orientation, and shutdown functions.

      To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
      module will be named a320.

      When enabled, ensure your device tree includes:
      - compatible = "avago,a320"
      - I2C address configuration (reg property)
      - Optional GPIO configurations for reset/motion control

      Requires I2C and GPIO support in the kernel.
